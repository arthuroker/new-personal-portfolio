# Building AI Products That Earn Trust

Great demos are easy to love and hard to depend on.

What users remember is not the one magical response. They remember whether your product was dependable when their task was high stakes.

## 1. Reliability before cleverness

If a feature fails 1 out of 5 times, users will route around it no matter how advanced the model is.

Prioritize:

- deterministic guardrails for critical paths
- graceful fallbacks when model output is low confidence
- clear recovery steps after errors

## 2. Explain why the model said that

Users need context, not just output. Show concise reasoning traces, source links, or confidence indicators where possible.

> Hidden uncertainty feels like product instability.

## 3. Keep the user in control

AI should speed up decisions, not make irreversible ones silently.

Use editability and approvals for sensitive actions. A simple principle works well: **suggest first, automate second**.

## Closing

Trust is not a launch event. It is a running score your product earns with every interaction.
